# Dotfiles

This repository holds all my main configuration files. They meet all (or almost all) of my daily
needs and I'm making them available in the hope that they can help others too, so feel free to suggest,
modify and use it as needed.

# (Neo)vim

File: [init.vim](init.vim)

## Installing (Neo)vim Plugins

All configuration requires [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as plugin manager,
so make sure to install it as soon as possible. After sucessfully installed, from _Normal Mode_,
type `:PlugInstall` and wait for the instalation to complete.

## External Dependencies

* [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation.html): it's used for lint, format and a lot of features used through the configuration file
* [nodejs > 12.12](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): it's required by [coc-nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)
* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug): a minimalist (Neo)vim plugin manager which install all required plugins

## Installing the Coc Extensions

Currently, the only required extension is [coc-clangd](https://github.com/clangd/coc-clangd).
From _Normal Mode_, type the command `:CocInstall coc-clangd` to install it and make sure to
configure the [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation.html) language server.

## Configuring the Coc Plugins

From _Normal Mode_, enter the _Command Mode_  by running `:CocConfig`. Then, copy and paste
the code bellow in the `coc-setting.json` file which will be opened.

```json
{
    "clang.enabled": true
}
```

# Clang-Format

File: [.clang-format](.clang-format)

The current (Neo)vim configuration is able to format your code automatically, always you save a file,
but it will follow the default clang-format rules. It's possible to change the default style guide
overriding it with a file called `.clang-format`. Just ensure to put it on the root directory of your project
(to change only this project) or on the parent directory to make it available for all child directories.

## External Dependencies

* clang-format > 13.0.1: There is a lot of ways to install clang-format (using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), _package manager_, and so on). Choose the better solution for you.

## How to Change the Style Guide

The current style guide is focusing on _data_ and not on the language syntax. If you don't like
that, you can change the style rules just by modifying the `.clang-format` file. Take a look at
[documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html) for more information.
